## My process

- This design utilized a very light and simple and responisive css boilerplate --[http://getskeleton.com/
](Skeleton). I started by making a few required changes in the default skeloton stylesheet for matching the color palet, active states, etc. I set a new container, then after adding in the supplied content, it was just a matter of creating classes for that content and styling them appropiatly to best match the example desktop design. 
### Built with
